# EmberQuill Studios Landing Page

**Selected Design Style: NERV Cyberpunk Theme**

---

## Overview

EmberQuill Studios is a Black-owned manga studio with a unified NERV-inspired cyberpunk aesthetic. ## Design Philosophy - NERV Aesthetic

The design evokes the feeling of an underground command terminal in a cyberpunk facility. Deep oceanic greens meet warning-sign orange. Phosphor glow on aging CRT monitors. The quiet hum of industrial control terminals meets the melancholic warmth inspired by Wong Kar-wai's cinematography.

### Visual Language

- **Terminal Interface**: Monospace typography, sharp geometric forms, minimal 2px borders
- **CRT Effects**: Subtle scan lines, phosphor glow, terminal flicker animations
- **Color Story**: Deep void background (#0a1612) with muted sage text (#8fb3a5) and signal orange accents (#e85d04)
- **Glassmorphism**: Subtle backdrop blur effects creating depth without heaviness
- **Mobile-First**: Unified responsive navigation, clean information hierarchy

### Content Hierarchy (60/30/10)

**60% - Manga Studio & Artists**
The primary focus showcases EmberQuill Studios' mission, the 4 featured artists (Blue Takatsuki, KittyWitxh, Artist Kai, Suppoku), Book One: The Last War, studio facilities, and the origin story. This content emphasizes the 5-year contracts, housing provided, and equitable design principles.

**30% - Artist Assets & Community**
Secondary content featuring the plush collection, level-up progression system, community benefits, and engagement opportunities. Balances commercial offerings with community building.

**10% - Crypto & Rewards**
Minimal but present: Shiba Inu currency integration, NFT minting options, Founder's Badge, and weekly airdrops. Crypto elements support the economy without dominating the experience.

### User Experience

Mobile-first unified navigation replaces separate menu components. Users encounter a terminal-style interface that feels precise, technical, yet warm. Every interaction reinforces the feeling of accessing a secure creative facility where artists thrive and honest work gets rewarded.

The single-page flow guides visitors from initial system initialization (hero) through studio information, artist profiles, featured work, community systems, and finally crypto integration—ending with a terminal status footer.

### Technical Implementation

- **Kit Components**: Reusable Button, Card, Section, Container, Badge, and Divider components
- **8px Grid System**: Consistent spacing throughout
- **Typography**: Share Tech Mono for body, Orbitron for displays
- **Animations**: Terminal-style transitions (150ms), subtle flicker effects, phosphor glow
- **Performance**: Optimized with Next.js 14, lazy loading, responsive images

### Brand Voice

Technical yet warm. Command terminal meets artist studio. Copy is concise, impactful, using the monospace aesthetic. The tone suggests an underground facility running a quiet revolution in creator empowerment.
